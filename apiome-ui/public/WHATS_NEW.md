# Apiome 07-2026 RC2

We continue to improve the platform based on your feedback with improvements and new features!

## Features

- Export: Emitter registry REST target list — `GET /v1/export/{tenant}/targets` enumerates every registered emitter with descriptor, capability profile, `options_schema` and `default_options`, and a per-source fidelity tier badge (`lossless`/`lossy`/`types-only`) computed without emitting (MFX-1.2)
- Browser: public export downloads are rate-limited and size-capped on the server; the dialog shows clear messages when throttled or the artifact is too large (MFX-7.3)
- Browser: public export dialog shows the full fidelity advisory + per-construct report, matching the ADE export flow (MFX-7.2)
- Export: `apiome export avro` writes Avro `.avsc` with the honest fidelity report; UI export-target metadata maps avro/avsc to Monaco `json` + `.avsc` download names (MFX-19.5)
- Export: Avro Schema Registry subjects — per-type Confluent subjects on each `.avsc` (`RecordNameStrategy` default; `TopicNameStrategy` / `TopicRecordNameStrategy` via emit options); nullable optional fields without source defaults get synthesized evolution defaults (MFX-19.3)
- Export: Avro fidelity pack — operations/channels critical DROP with "only data schemas are exported"; constraints DROP; unions OK when shape allows else APPROX; optional fields APPROX as `["null", T]` unions; evolution defaults SYNTH (MFX-19.2)
- Export: Avro emitter — canonical model → validated `.avsc` per named type (records, enums, unions, maps, fixed/logical scalars); nullability as `["null", T]` unions; date/timestamp/uuid/decimal logical types; names sanitized to Avro rules (MFX-19.1)
- Export: `apiome export graphql` writes GraphQL SDL with the honest fidelity report; UI export-target metadata maps graphql/gql/sdl to Monaco `graphql` + `.graphql` download names (MFX-13.5)
- Export: GraphQL validate + round-trip — emitted SDL is checked with `build_schema`/`validate_schema`, re-imported through the MFI GraphQL parser, and diffed against the source; predicted fidelity losses corroborated and divergences flagged (MFX-13.4)
- Export: GraphQL fidelity pack — REST HTTP method/path/status/headers are reported as APPROX when reframing to Query/Mutation fields (HTTP semantics have no GraphQL representation); validation constraints approximate as custom scalars; oneOf/unions report OK when member shapes allow (MFX-13.3)
- Export: GraphQL input/output type splitting — cross-paradigm request bodies and object-typed arguments synthesize deduplicated `{Name}Input` types so emitted SDL never uses output objects as inputs; synthesized inputs reported in the fidelity envelope (MFX-13.2)
- Export: GraphQL SDL emitter — canonical model → valid SDL via `graphql-core` `print_schema`; preserves nullability/list wrappers; Graph-native sources round-trip; REST sources map GET→Query and write verbs→Mutation (MFX-13.1)
- Export: `apiome export grpc` writes a proto3 `.proto` document with the honest fidelity report; UI export-target metadata maps protobuf/gRPC/proto3 to Monaco `protobuf` + `.proto` download names (MFX-12.5)
- Export: Protobuf fidelity pack — unions, nullability, constraints, inheritance, and arbitrary JSON losses are predicted as APPROX/SYNTH (not silent DROPs) when exporting OpenAPI/GraphQL sources to proto3; pub/sub operations reframed as unary rpc (MFX-12.3)
- Export: Stable protobuf field-number assignment — synthesized field numbers persist per artifact and are reused on re-export; new fields get the next free number honouring `reserved` ranges; reported as SYNTH in the fidelity report (MFX-12.2)
- Export: Per-target emit options — each registered emitter declares a Pydantic options model with JSON Schema + validated defaults on the registry target list; OpenAPI 3.1 and sample targets ship reference option sets (MFX-1.4)
- Export: Refactored existing OpenAPI export behind the Emitter SPI — catalog conversion and future export surfaces resolve emitters through the registry instead of direct emitter imports (MFX-1.3)
- Export: Emitter SPI + capability/fidelity profile — export targets register with descriptor metadata (key/label/icon/paradigm/single-vs-multi-file/toolchain), static capability profiles for fidelity prediction, and multi-file `EmitResult` envelopes; OpenAPI 3.1 and a no-op sample target ship as reference emitters (MFX-1.1)
- Import: OpenAPI-family conformance matrix (Swagger 2.0, OAS 3.0/3.1/3.2, Arazzo) runs in CI — detect/normalize agreement, entity counts, fingerprint stability, and Project routing are regression-gated (MFI-30.4)
- Import: OpenAPI 3.2 documents (QUERY method, additionalOperations, hierarchical tags) now import, normalize, lint, and publish through the multi-format SPI; fidelity preview notes 3.2→3.1 conversion

## Bug Fixes

- Import: Arazzo workflow documents now import through the multi-format SPI with canonical model, lint, and step-level diff support
- Browser: Updated to show MCP Catalog
- Browser: Updated to show activity spinner when searching
- Catalog: Implementation of the catalog to import API sources other than OpenAPI and Arazzo
- Catalog: Implements gRPC/Protobuf/GraphQL/AsyncAPI import cataloging
- CLI: Corrected Swagger 2.0 support in auto import mode
- CLI: Adds --force option to import so that warnings do not prevent publication
- CLI: Import shows correct elapsed time for an import job
- CLI: Adds "--import-timeout (seconds)" option to import to override 120 second timeout
- CLI: Adds MCP registration functionality to the system
- DB: Optimizations made to increase speed for import processing
- DB: Implements catalog storage and indexing
- Import: Corrected import for Swagger responses in paths to capture the schema properly for array items
- Import: Import speed greatly improved
- Import: Special cases with unicode characters are now properly handled
- Import: Better duplication checks - now compares project and version IDs before rejecting
- Import: Fixes publish flag when importing via CLI
- Import: Publish uses short note via description, title, or slug and version if not provided
- Import: Updates import service to include benchmarking output
- Import: Fixes linting problem in rare cases during import
- Import: Corrects base ref and $ref external dereferencing
- Import: Updating class creation step to increase speed using transactions and commits in groups
- Import: Catalog import dialog accepts `.zip`/`.tar.gz` archives for multi-file gRPC/GraphQL/AsyncAPI sources (MFI-29.1)
- Import: gRPC, GraphQL, and AsyncAPI adapters accept multi-document fileset input — split SDL, proto trees, and AsyncAPI suites resolve cross-file refs with identical fingerprints to pre-flattened imports (MFI-29.2)
- REST: Swagger 2.0 documents normalize into the canonical model through the import SPI (MFI-30.1), closing the detect-without-normalize gap for cross-format diff and catalog persistence
- Projects: Now displays quality and linting information in each project
- UI: Fixes Published Versions viewing of OpenAPI and Arazzo URLs
- UI: Fixes Published Versions list so versions starting with a "v" don't duplicate and show "vv"
- UI: Adds the ability to import MCP servers as an input for API cataloging
- UI: Adds MCP linting and scoring based on interally set criteria
- UI: Repositories are no longer in preview
- UI: MCP entries provide a small summary once imported
- UI: Updated MCP registries to be published either public or private
- UI: Applied Fable 5 to improve overall UI additions
- UI: Improved Profile layout
- UI: Fixed sidebar so that "Sunset Timeline" doesn't also highlight Projects at the same time
- UI: Fixed sidebar to be static with scrollable content to the right-hand side
- Naming: Renamed the project to Apiome
