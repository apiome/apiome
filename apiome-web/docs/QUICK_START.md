- Add email service integration (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)

**Sign Up/Sign In Forms**

## 🎨 Styling

The site uses Tailwind CSS with dark mode support. Colors and styles can be customized in:

- Individual component files - Component-specific styles

## 🧪 Testing

### Lint Code
```bash
yarn workspace apiome-web lint
```

cd apiome-web
yarn tsc --noEmit
```

## 📊 Build Output

Build successfully generates 9 static routes:
```

┌ ○ /
├ ○ /_not-found
├ ○ /community
├ ○ /contact
